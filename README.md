Get and Post App: This is a web application developed using the Django framework, allowing users to interact with the server through both GET and POST requests. It serves as a demonstration of how to handle different
     types of requests for various purposes, such as retrieving data and submitting form submissions.
Key Features:
   1. GET Request Handling: The application responds to GET requests by rendering dynamic web pages with data retrieved from the server. For example, users can access a homepage displaying information fetched from a
      database or an API.
   2. POST Request Handling: DjangoGetPostApp processes POST requests submitted by users, enabling actions such as form submissions, data updates, or user registrations. Upon receiving a POST request,the application
       validates and processes the data before updating the server or responding accordingly.
   3. Form Submission: Users can fill out and submit forms through the application's interface. The form data is sent to the server via a POST request, where it is processed and stored as necessary.Feedback messages
       or confirmation pages inform users of the outcome of their submissions.
   4. Data Persistence: DjangoGetPostApp utilizes Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with a database,ensuring persistent storage of application data.This allows for efficient retrieval,modification,
       and deletion of data in response to user actions.
   5. Input Validation: The application implements robust input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).Validation rules are
       applied to both GET and POST requests to maintain data consistency and user safety.
   6. Session Management: Django's built-in session management features are leveraged to maintain user sessions and track user interactions across multiple requests.This allows for personalized experiences and secure
       authentication mechanisms, enhancing the overall user experience.
